# Naive GaussianElimination

This project solve system of linear equation using Gaussian Elimination in Java. It inclludes forward elimination and back subtitution to find the value of the variable.

#How to Use 
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Compile the `NaiveGaussianElimination.java` file.
3. Run the program to see the solution of a system of equations

#Example
The program solves the following system of equation
`x1 - x2 + 2x3 + x4 = 1
3x1 + 2x2 + x3 + 4x4 = 1
5x1 + 8x2 + 6x3 + 3x4 = 1
4x1 + 2x2 + 5x3 + 3x4 = -1 `

#Running the program
1. compile the code
   `javac NaiveGaussianElimination.java`
2. run the program
   `java NaiveGaussianElimination.java`

The program will print each values of x1, x2, x3, x4
